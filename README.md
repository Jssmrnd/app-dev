3 Idiots is a Bollywood production that flashes back and forth between present day, and the characters' time in college. It starts off with old friends, *Qureshi* and *Raju Rastogi* learning that their college pal, *Rancho*, had finally been found. The movie follows their travels to find their long lost friend, while flashing back to the events of their school years, where they often got into amusing shenanigans involving the Dean of Delhi's Imperial College of Engineering, Viru Sahastrabudhe, and dealt with some serious events that many people encounter in every day life.

## What is the best part of the movie was best for me?

![main-qimg-00e6b6d36f9641a9a005dfb2bb07e169-pjlq](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102494237/206696672-8526a41f-7dbe-49b8-90d8-a9216bb734c9.jpg)

It it ***The handing over of the astronaut pen*** to Rancho by Virus is one of the best moments in the film. The most important and dramatic scene, in my opinion.

A very emotional scene for me ðŸ˜­

A turning point in the extraordinary Virus's development, one that took 37 years of owning the pen for him to recognize his major error or shortcoming. Due to his error, issues with his college system, Lobo's suicide, the passing of his sibling, Raju's suicide, and other things occurred.

> He finally turned over the pen to Rancho after admitting his error and realizing the value of the pupil he despised the most.

However, you can see that Virus was unable to remove his pride and ego, telling Rancho that he was mistaken to claim that scientists could use pencils in space instead of astronaut pens and save millions of dollars.

That **"You cannot always be right! Do you comprehend?"** is equivalent to saying, **"I admit my mistakes, but you also commit. Everyone makes mistakes; no one is perfect. so please bear with me."**

>With his adult pride, perhaps Virus could not afford to tell Rancho directly that he made a mistake and regretted it. However, giving that astronaut's pen would suggest that he was sincere in his expression of regret.
